Entering the professional world can be a challenging transition. It's a different environment with a more rigid team structure, and it's often the first time individuals work closely with others outside of their peer group with shared experiences. These are the lessons that took me a bit to learn, but found the most valuable

### 1. It's all about the people

Except in rare cases, companies are almost always a group of people working together toward a common goal. The bigger an organization gets, the more people have to work together (and agree) to accomplish something. This is a common reason why clearly good ideas don't always find their footing in different companies, and why it's not enough to simply do "good work" and expect a good results - both for the company and for your own personal career. As a note

Even more importantly, working with friendly and reasonable people can be a primary reason you enjoy your job. Conversely, working with aggressive and unreasonable people is almost certainly a reason to not enjoy your job.

### 2. Be yourself

Sometimes it's hard to bring your authentic personality to work. The quicker you can feel comfortable, the quicker you'll be able to contribute your ideas more meaningfully.

### 3. Be honest and curious about what you want

For most people, their first career choice isn't going to be the path they take for their entire life. Before you start, might not know if you like it, and you might also not know what other fields are out there. Prioritize what's important to you - the content that you're working on, the type of work, compensation, lifestyle, etc., and work hard to get there - it's easier to transition earlier in your career than later.

### 4. First impressions matter

Establishing a reputation for being a high-performer early on is something that follows you throughout your time at an organization. As momentum builds, it because easier for others (your peers and those more senior) to trust your judgement, work ethic, and results.

### 5. Knowing when and how to say "no" increases your chance for success

Sometimes, having a good attitude and jumping on any project that comes your way is effective in increasing your scope and ownership. However, at a certain point, it becomes more important to focus on key projects. It'll help you drive focus and better results. Being spread too thin can easily lead to burnout.
